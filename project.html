            Pollution, sun exposure and other environmental stressors cause free radical damage to your skin.
             These free radicals break down the collagen and elastin fibres in the skin to make fine lines and wrinkles appear sooner 
             and more prominently. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can help address the problem of premature ageing.
             Apples contain plenty of vitamin C and when consumed on a regular basis, can reduce the premature signs of ageing on 
             the skin.

            <br> <u><strong> How to use:</strong> </u>
            To reap apple benefits for the skin, extract the juice of an apple and apply all over the face and neck
             area using a cotton ball. Allow it to dry and then rinse using water, do this 2-3 times a week for best results.
